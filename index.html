        <h1>This is a motherfunking website.</h1>

        	<p>and this it's fucking perfect</p>

        <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>

        	<p>You probably build websites and thing your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-alive </br> home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. </br> You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has bow-shadow. 
        	</br>Wrong, motherfucker. Let met describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Shits’s lightweight and loads fast</li>
        	<li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        	<li>The motherfucker’s accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        	<li>Shit’s legible and gets your fucking point acrros (if you had ne instead of just 5mb pic of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
